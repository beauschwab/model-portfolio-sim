# AGENTS.md — skills

## Production execution contract (0.29.4; supersedes historical defaults)

Rust is the required production financial runtime. Python calculation is deprecated;
it is retained only as an independent test/reference oracle, not an API/UI backend.
New and omitted `compute_backend` settings resolve to `rust`. Historical explicit
Python snapshots remain readable, but must be switched to Rust and their libraries/
sessions rebuilt before production execution. Never silently change saved economics
or fall back when native libraries are missing.

Implement new built-in pricing, graph/coordinator, simulation, capital/FTP and solver
financial logic in Rust. HiGHS stays C++; Rust owns LP construction, invocation and
allocation validation. Production pricing/what-if must enter the native graph with
no custom discount-backend override. Do not reintroduce Python/NumPy/Numba execution
choices in application requests or controls. Keep Python oracles explicit in tests
so parity cannot accidentally compare Rust with itself. Defaults/ownership tests
must run outside the reference test context and forbid Python financial callbacks.

The existing FastAPI/worker, persistence/artifact transport and independent verifier
still use Python; this change does not claim a Rust HTTP/storage service. Keep quant
logic out of adapters. See `docs/rust-production-contract.md` at the repository root
for deployment, compatibility and validation rules. Preserve fixed OAS, CRN, final
output tolerances, immutable publication and the coefficient-only interactive path.

`portfolio-risk-engine/` is the OPERATOR skill: it teaches an LLM agent to USE
the engine (workflows, schemas, performance expectations, disclosure
duties). It is intentionally separate from the AGENTS.md hierarchy, which
documents MODIFYING the engine. Keep them consistent: any behavior change
updates both the skill references and src/portfolio_risk/AGENTS.md. The
canonical skill source lives at the repo author's skill folder; this copy
ships with the repo for SKILLFORGE-style distribution — regenerate the
.skill artifact after edits (skill-creator package_skill).
